Output eachtime this happens.c.Make sure your program has at least one function other than main. This function should be in its own source file and have its own .hheader file. You will also need a source file for the main body, so your main.c, func.hand func.cd.[10pt] You must include a Makefilethat will build the executable and it should be nameddeater.Example:$ deater5 2 8 dog cat dogc dogcat 7 10 15should output:Total integers: 47dog is a substring of dogcdog is a substring of dogcatcat is a substring of dogcatdogc is a substring of dogcat
